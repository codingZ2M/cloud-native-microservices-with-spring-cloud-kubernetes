 Making Microservices Resilient - Handling Failures Gracefully with Fallback Mechanism using RESILIENCE4J Fault Tolerance Library 
 by Implementing Circuit Breaker Pattern
 
 Note: You can have any number of Circuit Breaker patterns with different configurations for your API's

Add resilience4j-spring-boot2, resilience4j-circuitbreaker, resilience4j-timelimiter, spring-boot-starter-aop dependencies.
Add the configurations for the Circuit Breaker patterns in the application.properties.

And, then apply the Circuit Breaker patterns in the required controller methods which are handling REST API calls and also create Fallback methods to send fast response when Circuit Breaker is open during failures.
