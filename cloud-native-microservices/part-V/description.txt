Handling Routing & Cross-Cutting Concerns in Spring Boot Microservices - Building API Gateways
Spring Cloud Gateway - An effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns.
What is Spring Cloud Gateway?
1.) Create a Spring Cloud Gateway ( A Spring Boot Application) by adding the required dependencies and enabling the required properties in the applications.properties.
2.) Add gatewayserver.properties in the Git Repository and mention the spring cloud gateway server location inside your Gateway serer applications' properties file to identify the file "gatewayserver.properties" in the config server.
3.) Enable @EnableEurekaClient to fetch all the details from Eureka Server.

Note: Start Spring Cloud Config Server, Eureka Server and all your microservices and then start the Spring Cloud Gateway Server.
