Spring Cloud Gateway - An effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns.
What is Spring Cloud Gateway?
1.) Create a Spring Cloud Gateway ( A Spring Boot Application) by adding the required dependencies and enabling the required properties in the applications.properties.
2.) Add gatewayserver.properties in the Git Repository and mention the spring cloud gateway server location to identify the file "gatewayserver.properties" 
in the config server.
